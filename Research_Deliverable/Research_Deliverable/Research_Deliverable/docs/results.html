  <h5 style = "padding: 30px; text-align: center;">United States of America</h5>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        An important feature to note about the United States of America is that it is an individualist culture (Shkodriani & Gibbons, 1995), which is 
        defined as believing in individual freedom and emphasizing individual successes and self-reliance (Awad et al., 2018). Additionally, individualist 
        cultures focus more on separation of self and less on allegiance to society or family and competition. Typically, individualism and capitalism coincide, 
        often focusing on competition. (Awad et al., 2018; Realo & Allik, 1999)
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <h5 style="text-indent:30px; padding: 30px;">Corpus and Analytic Procedure</h5>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        The data for the U.S. were drawn from the News on the Web (NOW) Corpus, a large-scale archive containing approximately 23 billion words from online 
        magazines and newspapers published between 2010 and the present across twenty English-speaking countries. All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.3) 
        using text-processing and data-analysis packages such as tidyverse and quanteda. Each article was treated as a single text document. Texts were tokenized, 
        converted to lowercase, and stripped of punctuation and stop words before dictionary lookup.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent:30px;">
        Two dictionaries were used: one related to disability and one related to moral foundations. Both dictionaries were expanded and refined using 
        large-language-model (LLM) assistance (Ai2’s OLMo-2 32B) to ensure comprehensive lexical coverage, including synonyms, plural forms, and regional variants. 
        Examples of disability-related terms include amputee, cane, invalid (now considered derogatory), and visually impaired. Moral-foundation terms included 
        words such as compassion, kindness, sympathy, victim, and unharmed.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <img src="plots/us_term_plot.png" height = 400 width = 600 alt="US: Moral Foundations when Disability Term is present" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; padding: 30px">
  
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        For each article, we computed binary indicators for whether any disability term and/or any moral-foundation term appeared. We then estimated the mean 
        probability of moral-foundation word occurrence conditional on the presence of a disability term. Results indicated that the probability of a 
        moral-foundation term was higher in texts that mentioned disability than in those that did not. When broken down by moral-foundation category (Harm/Care, 
        Fairness/Cheating, Authority/Subversion, Loyalty/Betrayal, Purity/Degradation), the largest differences occurred for the Harm and Fairness foundations. 
        The Authority foundation showed a slight increase when a disability term was present, but its 95% confidence interval overlapped zero, indicating a 
        nonsignificant difference (p > .05).
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <img src="plots/us_plot.png" height = 400 width = 600 alt="US: Moral Foundations when Disability Term is present" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; padding: 30px;">

  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
       In summary, disability discourse in U.S. news sources most strongly co-occurred with moral language linked to individualist concerns—harm and 
       fairness—consistent with the broader individualist orientation of American culture.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <h5 style = "padding: 30px; text-align: center;">Mexico</h5>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        Collectivism, rather than individualism, is an important feature of Mexican culture (Shkodriani & Gibbons, 1995). Collectivism emphasizes group harmony 
        and obligations to family, community, and tradition rather than personal autonomy (Awad et al., 2018; Gregory & Munch, 1997). Moral foundations commonly 
        associated with collectivism include authority/respect, loyalty/betrayal, and purity/sanctity.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>



  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        The same analytic framework used for the U.S. data was applied to Mexican news texts. Two parallel Spanish-language dictionaries were developed—one for 
        disability and one for moral foundations—by translating the English terms, expanding them using LLM-assisted generation, and validating them against 
        native-speaker judgments. Although the NOW Corpus contains Mexican sources, we supplemented it with a Mexico-specific news corpus to increase coverage 
        and used the Spanish originals rather than machine-translated texts.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <img src="plots/mex_term_plot.png" height = 400 width = 600 alt="US: Moral Foundations when Disability Term is present" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; padding: 30px">


  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
        As in the U.S. analysis, the probability of moral-foundation language was compared across texts with and without disability terms using mean differences 
        and bootstrap-estimated confidence intervals. On average, the proportion of moral-foundation terms was significantly higher when a disability term appeared 
        (error = 0.0266). The largest increases occurred for the Harm and Purity foundations, whereas Fairness, Ingroup, and Authority showed negligible or 
        nonsignificant differences.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <img src="plots/mex_plot.png" height = 400 width = 600 alt="Mexico: Moral Foundations when Disability Term is present" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; padding: 30px">


  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
        These findings suggest that in Mexican media, discussions of disability often invoke moral language centered on care and purity—consistent with collectivist 
        themes of interdependence, protection, and moral cleanliness.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <h5 style = "padding: 30px; text-align: center;">Russia</h5>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
       Russian culture is also broadly collectivist but differs from Mexican collectivism in its stronger emphasis on authority and respect for the state rather 
       than familial duty (Martz et al., 2009; Realo & Allik, 1999). This orientation reflects the legacy of the Soviet period, when loyalty to social order and 
       obedience to authority were strongly enforced.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        As no pre-existing Russian-language dictionaries for disability or moral foundations were available, we constructed them by translating the English source 
        dictionaries using OLMo-2 (32B) and then verifying each translation with a native Russian speaker. These dictionaries were applied to the Lenta Corpus, a 
        large-scale collection of Russian news texts. The same tokenization and lookup procedures were used as in prior analyses.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <img src="plots/rus_term_plot.png" height = 400 width = 600 alt="US: Moral Foundations when Disability Term is present" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; padding: 30px">


  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
      Results indicated that the “Fairness/Injustice” (individualizing) and “Authority/Subversion” (binding) foundations appeared most frequently in texts mentioning 
      disability, whereas “Care/Harm,” “Purity/Sanctity,” and “Ingroup” terms appeared less often.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <img src="plots/rus_plot.png" height = 400 width = 600 alt="Russia: Moral Foundations when Disability Term is present" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; padding: 30px">


  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
       This pattern aligns with Russia’s socio-cultural emphasis on respect for authority and social conformity, suggesting that disability discourse there is 
       framed in terms of fairness and social order rather than compassion or purity. 
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h5 style ="padding: 30px;">Cross-Cultural Comparison</h5>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        Across all three countries, results reflect their distinct cultural orientations. The U.S., a highly individualist society, showed the strongest 
        associations between disability and care or fairness language. Mexico, a familial and collectivist society, emphasized care and purity foundations. 
        Russia, shaped by state-oriented collectivism, linked disability most strongly to fairness and authority. Together, these findings demonstrate that 
        the moral framing of disability varies systematically with cultural values, highlighting how collective versus individualist moral concerns shape 
        public discourse.
