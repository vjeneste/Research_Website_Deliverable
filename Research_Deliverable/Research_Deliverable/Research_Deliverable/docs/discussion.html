        In summary, Russia and Mexico, the more collectivist cultures in this research, displayed both binding and individualizing 
        moral foundations in news headlines, thereby showing some similarity with the United States. The Mexico corpus demonstrated 
        that the Care-Harm (an individualizing value), and Purity-Sanctity foundation (a binding value), were the most common when a 
        disability term was present. The Russian corpus showed that the fairness-injustice foundation (individualizing), and 
        authority-subversion foundation (binding) were invoked the most when a disability term was present. Lastly, when a disability 
        term was present, the moral values of care-harm and fairness-injustive appeared the most. Our results suggest that the topic of 
        disability is indeed moralized and that this is true across cultures: at least one of the Moral Foundations values appeared when a 
        disability term was present in a news headline in each of the US, Russia, and Mexico. Therefore, all three countries refer to disability 
        with a sense of “right” and “wrong” and moral responsibility in the media.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        For Russia, the two foundations that showed up the most were a combination of an individualizing and binding value, most likely because of its 
        technological advancements as a “western” power. The first foundation that appeared the most was the “Fairness and Injustice” value, which probably 
        referred to the disadvantages that people with disabilities face in Russia.  The second was “Authority and Subversion”, which may mean that there is a 
        value in either the higher authority, such as the heads of state or the country, in professionals in general, or even “higher” members of a family like 
        adults or members who are “more able”. In this case, the latter is the most probable considering that Russia is a collectivist society, which still 
        emphasizes a family’s or a community’s needs over the individual. 
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        For Mexico, the two foundations most apparent were also a combination of individualizing and binding values, possibly for the same reasons as Russia. The 
        two foundations were the “Care and Harm” and “Purity and Sanctity” values. The “Care and Harm” value for Mexico may mean that there is an expectation to 
        aid the lesser-abled members of a family or a community, thus emphasizing care in news headlines. The “Purity and Sanctity” value is due to the homogeneity 
        that a collectivist society expects of its individuals. This may mean that there is a certain expectation for a tight-knit group of individuals who are 
        similar to each other, therefore may be referring to people with disabilities in a negative way. However, this value can also have a more positive outlook 
        on these individuals by emphasizing their need because they don’t abide by the social norms, therefore calling its members to action.  
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        Lastly, the United States, the most individualist country in this research, demonstrated strictly individualizing values: Care/Harm and Fairness/Injustice. 
        This was expected due to its emphasis on breaking the status quo and praising the success of the individual. 
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        These differences in representation, especially in the news which is a very powerful source of cultural representations, may have downstream consequences 
        for differences in policy, law, and even opportunities for people who are differently-abled. For instance, the United States has had a much more open 
        discussion of disability than most other countries, and there are many schools and civil society actors that aim to support the differently-abled. However, 
        other countries such as Russia and Mexico who are more collectivist, may exhibit less opportunities for support that go beyond the immediate family or even 
        schools for children. 
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <h5 style = "text-indent: 30px" style="padding: 20px"> Limitations </h5>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        Some of the corpora of the countries in this research had a limited number of media outlets in comparison to the United States, which had the most one by far. 
        Therefore, this research did not encompass all news headlines in Russia and Mexico which may have limited our results. Additionally, the countries selected 
        did not maximize the difference across the individualist-collectivist spectrum. The United States is one of the most individualist countries, but Russia and 
        Mexico are more in the middle of the spectrum (as seen in the results of this research). Other countries that may have been included in this research are 
        South or East Asian countries such as India or China. (Triandis, 2015) Because our test is more conservative, it’s very surprising that there is a 
        cross-cultural difference despite not maximizing the spectrum. 
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <h5 style = "text-indent: 30px" style="padding: 20px"> Future Research </h5>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        Future research should investigate the direct effects on the members of the community who have disabilities. This research mainly focused on the representation 
        of this group of individuals through a journalist’s lens, who may or may not have a disability themselves. Therefore, focusing more on personal experiences may 
        lead to a more comprehensive comparison of sentiments and representations of people with disabilities. Additionally, another way to investigate further this 
        cross-cultural research is to collect qualitative perspectives of community members not just within the United States, Mexico, and Russia, but more broadly 
        across continents and countries.
