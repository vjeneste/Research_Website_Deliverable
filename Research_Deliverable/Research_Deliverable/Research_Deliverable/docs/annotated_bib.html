      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">	
        The main idea of this paper was to outline previous and recent texts on disability studies and how they have changed through time. Based on 
        one of the books used in his research, Tom Shakespeare summarizes that from 1990 to the early 2000s, there has been little progress for differently-abled 
        people. As Shakespeare outlines other books, he claims that these texts argue that there still is little progress in activism and in disability studies. 
        I might use this source for general background information for my research.

	      The main argument of this paper was to provide an overview on cultural influence on people with intellectual disabilities. The author’s point of view 
        was that negative perspectives or beliefs towards differently-abled people can cause double-discrimination and diagnostic overlooking. The article offers 
        a solution to this problem: addressing cultural barriers and improving relationships with caregivers and professionals. I would use this source for specific 
        background information since it outlines a few examples on cultural views and how they affect how people are diagnosed and treated.

      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
	      The main point of this paper was how the field “disability studies” is defined and what its role is. Ferguson and Nusbaum, the authors of this article, 
        outlined core concepts of disability studies, stating that this field should be interdisciplinary, values-based, foundational (meaning it also informs us 
        how to define other categories of human difference), and participatory. I might use this source for background information because it outlines different 
        aspects of disability studies which I could use throughout my research.

        This source argued the difference between US and Russian disability prototypes and attitudes towards certain disabilities: hearing impediments, AIDS, and 
        physical impairment. The main distinction between the attitudes of the US and Russia was that Russia focuses more on the negative aspects of the disability. 
        I found this article very interesting because of its cross cultural comparison between two cultures that I am familiar with. I would use this in my research 
        because of its relevancy to my topic and its analysis of representation.

      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
	      This source outlined the differences in attitude towards hearing loss in different cultures. For instance, India is more focused on the opportunities for 
        treatment rather than the other cultures, who focus more on the negative aspects of hearing loss such as difficulties communicating. Additionally, the UK, 
        for instance, views hearing loss as a “disability” which can lead to more stigma around people who experience hearing loss. I would use this in my research 
        because of how it compares different cultures, and this article exposed me to new cultures that I do not have personal experiences with.

      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
	      This article was incredibly interesting because Gammeltoft, the author, interviewed around 30+ families who have at least one member who has a disability 
        and how their lives are impacted. Additionally, he also spoke to each individual with a disability. What was very striking to me was that some of the 
        disabilities were hardly noticeable, according to Gammeltoft, yet those families had the same reaction as families with a member who was visibly disabled. 
        Near the end of this article, Gammeltoft also analyzed important aspects of North Vietnamese culture, such as Buddhism and the value of working, and how it 
        influences peoples’ view on disabilities. I will be using this source in my research because it not only discusses personal experiences in a culture that I 
        am interested in, but also how the values of a culture influence representation and taxonomy.

	      This source outlines an experiment that collected data from both American and Mexican citizens with respect to physical and mental limitations as they age. 
        The article claims that socio-economic and demographic factors that are specific to each country affect the respective groups of citizens over the age of 65. 
        I think that this source would be good to use as preliminary background research into my specific cross-cultural research because of how it outlines the 
        differences between the two countries, but does not delve deeper into why the differences occur.

	      This source conducted an experiment to determine the difference, if any, in collectivism in American, Estonian (ethnically Russian and Estonian), and 
        Russian cultures. They collected their data by asking students from these groups to write “I am…” statements in a single theme (ie: family, occupation, 
        etc). The authors deduced that Russian students in Moscow were the most collectivist, the ethnically Russian Estonians were actually the least collectivist, 
        and the American students were in the middle. Although this cross-cultural study also compared Russian and American culture to Estonian culture, I would 
        use this source in my research because it outlines the differences in American and Russian culture.

	      This source outlined the differences within the United States and made inferences, based on the history and traditions, on how collectivist or 
        individualist regions would be. They found that Hawaii was the most collectivist and Montana was the most individualist. I think that I would use 
        this as background information to my research or as evidence for possible limitations in my cross-cultural study.

	      This source examines the familial norms and role as well as the prevalence of collectivism in Mexico and determines the importance of cultural values in 
        international advertising. The study found that product advertisements that were tailored to collectivist familial norms were more effective than 
        international ones that solely translated. Although advertisements are not part of my research, I found it interesting how this article connected 
        collectivism to familial values specifically in Mexico. So, I would use this source in my research because of the values it outlines and their importance 
        in Mexican culture, generally.

	      This source examined individualism and collectivism among American and Mexican university students. A questionnaire with a set of statements was sent to 
        American and Mexican students asking them to rank from 0-5 how much they agree with these statements. It was deduced that American students were more 
        individualist than Mexican students who were on average more collectivist. This article broke down the groups of statements–such as family, authority, 
        neighbor relationships–and how they reflected the values of each culture. For instance, Mexican culture values, on average, emphasize closeness of a 
        family, taking care of older generations, and cooperation, and American cultural values emphasize separation of self and competition. I will use this in 
        my research to indicate why I chose Mexican and American cultures (and their differences) as well as what values, such as collectivist or individualist, 
        can influence representations of people with disabilities in the media.
