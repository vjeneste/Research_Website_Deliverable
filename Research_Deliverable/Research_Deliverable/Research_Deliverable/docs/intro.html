        	Imagine a girl who has autism living from an immigrant Russian family in the United States. In Russian culture, it is custom to aid immediate family and 
          sometimes inhibit members who may not be “socially capable” to self-sustain and keep them under care of another family member. However, in the United 
          States, there are many initiatives such as schools and volunteering non-profits that attempt to provide people with disabilities the opportunity to 
          self-determine and self-sustain their life. The contrast between those two cultures clashing within one household begs the question as to why they assume 
          responsibility for people with disabilities in different ways. This research poses this question.

      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        Individualist and collectivist cultures differ on the goal and values of its society and whether its members emphasize individuality or community. 
        (Triandis, 2015) For instance, individualistic cultures usually expect its members to focus on themselves and possibly their immediate family, and there 
        aren’t many values that tie the individual to the society. Often, these individuals are encouraged to break the status quo. (Vandello & Cohen, 1999) For 
        the United States, its individualistic characteristics are that it is a capitalist country, focused on competition, and there is emphasis on pushing the 
        boundaries of social norms. (Shkodriani & Gibbons, 1995) This may be the case because of the myriad cultures present in the United States. For collectivist 
        cultures, its members are expected to focus on immediate family as well as extended family, its surrounding community or the state over the individual. 
        Often, the needs of the family or community are above the individual and cohesion is greatly valued. (Triandis, 2015)

      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        The Moral Foundations Theory suggests that human culture is based on five groups of innate moral “foundations” that affect a society’s norms and values. 
        This theory was developed by Jonathan Haidt and Jesse Graham who state that different cultures, using these five values, build narratives, institutions, 
        and ethics, thus affecting what we perceive as “right” and “wrong.” These different values and combination of said values create the basis on moral 
        decision making, and therefore overarching values within a culture and are demonstrated in the diversity of moral beliefs we see today. (Awad et al., 2018; 
        Graham et al., 2009, 2011) These morals are categorized as Care and Harm; Fairness and Cheating; Loyalty and Betrayal; Authority and Subversion; and Purity 
        and Sanctity. (Awad et al., 2018) Individualist cultures often emphasize the individualizing values: Care/Harm and Fairness/Cheating values. In contrast, 
        collectivist cultures focus on the binding values: Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, and Purity/Sanctity moral foundations. (Awad et al., 2018) For 
        instance, cultures that focus on loyalty and respect to authority, two binding values in the Moral Foundations Theory are considered collectivist, stressing 
        the importance of a community. Theories of individualist-collectivist cultural differences complement moral foundations theory insofar as different moral 
        foundations are endorsed to differing degrees across individualist and collectivist cultures. They provide the theoretical basis for our research here.

  <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        	Disability, by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, is defined as a physical or mental impairment that limits a person’s participation in 
          certain activities and interaction with the world around them. (CDC, 2025) Although there are definitions and certain diagnostics for disabilities 
          medically, society also creates certain social definitions and establishes groups that can help or inhibit differently-abled people socially. As 
          Lennard J. Davis describes it, social norms are actions that are expected of an individual of a society. Additionally, the concept of the “average 
          person” is the ideal position that someone should be, and anyone who strays from that is not average. Therefore, extremes can either be looked upon as 
          “good” and others as “bad.” (Davis, 2016) Thus, society’s definition of the “ideal person” can differ in each culture or country, legally, socially, 
          and medically and outcast other groups as not the social idea. (Brooks & Bates, n.d.) In this research, the effects of social values, and therefore 
          the establishment of social construct, were examined in the media, specifically news headlines. Different emphases on moral foundations can create 
          different social definitions of disability and define the responsibility of its citizens to help. For instance, a collectivist culture that focuses 
          on loyalty as a moral value can emphasize familial obligation to take care of the person with the disability.

  <!-- Paragraph 6 -->
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        Mexican, American, and Russian cultures were chosen in how they represent and refer to disabilities based on their values, or moral foundations. Mexico 
        is a good culture to compare because of how it’s more collectivist from the United States, which could demonstrate different moral values. Mexico therefore 
        can also demonstrate different constructions of disabilities and the attitudes towards the differently-abled. Additionally, there is enough recent data 
        that is accessible in Spanish in a corpus, especially pertaining to news headlines, to gather and compare to the United States. I think that American 
        culture would be interesting to dive deeper into because of its individualistic values and heavy emphasis on competition and individual success in 
        comparison to Mexico and Russia. The US will most likely have the most collectable and accessible data tailored for this research because it has more 
        experiences with open discussion of topics around disability and the field of disability studies. Russia would also be an interesting cultural viewpoint 
        in this research project because of its different cultural, collectivist values from the US. In comparison to Mexico’s values of family and a welcoming, 
        tight-knit community, Russia is more focused on national pride, more rigid traditions, strength, and respect or submission to higher authority. 
        Additionally, because of the technological advancements and population size of Russia, there is ample data to gather.  
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Paragraph 7 -->
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        	In summary, Mexican and Russian cultures are defined as more collectivist and the United States is more individualist. (Gregory & Munch, 1997; Martz et 
          al., 2009) However, Mexico and Russia are collectivist in different ways. Mexico emphasises a collective within their own culture and bases many of its 
          values off of familial obligation whereas Russia stresses loyalty and subversion to the state. (Martz et al., 2009)
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Paragraph 8 -->
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        The question that drove this research was whether collectivist or individualistic cultures predict different value representations of disabilities in 
        Russian, American, and Mexican news headlines. With new knowledge gathered from existing literature and experiments on disabilities and collectivist and 
        individualistic cultures, it seemed advantageous to compare multiple countries, on different parts of the individualist to collectivist spectrum. By 
        learning how such values impact social norms and expectations, I wondered what differences there are in representation and sentiment towards disability 
        in different cultures and languages, if any.

    <ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 30px">
        In brief, dictionaries, or lists with specific terms, were found pertaining to disabilities and moral foundations in Spanish and English. However, Russian 
        dictionaries were not found, and therefore translated from the English dictionary using which was also checked by a native speaker. These dictionaries were 
        then cross-referenced with data sets of news headlines in each country with the use of a coding language called R. The results of this data collection were 
        numerical values of how often a headline had a disability term and also a moral foundations term.
