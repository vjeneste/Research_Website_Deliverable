        In summary, Russia and Mexico, the more collectivist cultures in this research, displayed both binding and individualizing moral 
        foundations in news headlines, therefore showing similarity with the United States. The Mexico corpus demonstrated that the 
        foundations of “Care and Harm”, an individualizing value, and “Purity and Sanctity”, a binding value, were the most apparent 
        when a disability term was present. The Russian corpus showed that the foundations of “Fairness and Injustice”, an individualizing 
        value, and “Authority and Subversion”, a binding value, were referenced the most when a disability term was present. Lastly, 
        when a disability term was present, the moral values of “Care and Harm” and “Fairness and Injustice” appeared the most. It was 
        discerned that the topic of disability is a moralized value, because at least one of the Moral Foundations values appeared when 
        a disability term was present in a news headline. Therefore, all three countries refer to disability with a sense of “right” and 
        “wrong” and responsibility in the media.

    </ul>

        For Russia, the two foundations that showed up the most were a combination of an individualizing and binding value, most likely 
        because of its technological advancements as a “western” power. The first foundation that appeared the most was the “Fairness and 
        Injustice” value, which probably referred to the disadvantages that people with disabilities face in Russia.  The second was 
        “Authority and Subversion”, which may mean that there is a value in either the higher authority, such as the heads of state or 
        the country, in professionals in general, or even “higher” members of a family like adults or members who are “more able”. In this 
        case, the latter is the most probable considering that Russia is a collectivist society, which still emphasizes a family’s or a 
        community’s needs over the individual. 
      </p>
    </ul>

        For Mexico, the two foundations most apparent were also a combination of individualizing and binding values for the same reason 
        as Russia. The two foundations were the “Care and Harm” and “Purity and Sanctity” values. The “Care and Harm” value for Mexico 
        may mean that there is an expectation to aid for the lesser-abled members of a family or a community, thus emphasizing care in news 
        headlines. The “Purity and Sanctity” value is due to the homogeneity that a collectivist society expects of its individuals. This 
        may mean that there is a certain expectation for a tight-knit group of individuals who are similar to each other, therefore may be 
        referring to people with disabilities in a negative way. However, this value can also have a more positive outlook on these 
        individuals by emphasizing their need because they don’t abide by the social norms, therefore calling its members to action.  
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <ul>
      <p>
        Lastly, the United States, the most individualist country in this research, demonstrated strictly individualizing values: 
        "Care and Harm" and "Fairness and Injustice". This was expected due to its emphasis on breaking the status quo and praising 
        the success of the individual. 
      </p>
    </ul>

  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
        These differences in representation, especially in the news which is a very powerful outlet, may indicate differences in policy, 
        law, and opportunities for people who are differently-abled in our society. For instance, the United States has had a much more 
        open forum of discussion pertaining to people with disabilities, and there are many schools and nonprofits that aim to support 
        the differently-abled. However, other countries such as Russia and Mexico who are more collectivist, may exhibit less opportunities 
        for support that go beyond the immediate family or even schools for children. 
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <h5 style = "padding: 30px"> Limitations </h5>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
        Some of the corpora of the countries in this research had a limited number of media outlets in comparison to the United State, 
        which had the biggest one by far. Therefore, this research did not encompass all news headlines in Russia and Mexico which may 
        have limited our results. Additionally, the countries selected did not maximize the difference across the individualist-collectivist 
        spectrum. The United States is one of the most individualist countries, but Russia and Mexico are more in the middle of the spectrum 
        (as seen in the results of this research). Other countries that may have been included in this research are South or East Asian 
        countries such as India or China. (Triandis, 2015) Because our test is more conservative, it’s very surprising that there is a 
        cross-cultural difference despite not maximizing the spectrum. 
      </p>

  <h5 style = "padding: 30px"> Applications </h5>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
        Future research should investigate the direct effects on the members of the community who have disabilities. This research mainly 
        focused on the representation of this group of individuals through a journalist’s lens, who may or may not have a disability 
        themselves. Therefore, focusing more on personal experiences may lead to a more comprehensive comparison of sentiments and 
        representations of people with disabilities. Additionally, another way to investigate further this cross-cultural research is to 
        collect qualitative perspectives of community members not just within the United States, Mexico, and Russia, but more broadly 
        across continents and countries.
