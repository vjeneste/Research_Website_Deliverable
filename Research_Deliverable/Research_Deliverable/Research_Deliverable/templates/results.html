  <h1>Disability in the Digital World: How Representation Varies Across Cultures and Languages</h1>
  <h3>Section 3: Results</h3>


  <h5> United States of America: </h5>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
        An important feature to note about the United States of America is that it is an individualist culture (Shkodriani & Gibbons, 1995),
        which is defined as believing in individual freedom and emphasizing individual successes and self-reliance (Awad et al., 2018).
        Additionally, individualist cultures focus more on separation of self and less on allegiance to society or family and competition.
        Typically, individualism and capitalism coincide, often focusing on competition. (Awad et al., 2018; Realo & Allik, 1999)

        The data for the U.S. compiled in this experiment is from the News on the Web Corpus, which compiles texts (about 23 billion words 
        currently) from online magazines and newspapers from 20 different English-speaking countries from 2010 to present day. The corpus 
        was looked through by coding language R, which allowed for a lookup of the amount of times certain words in the disability and moral 
        foundations dictionary. Both dictionaries were found and extended (with the use of LLMs) that contained key words that pertained to 
        disabilities and moral foundations. Some terms in the disability dictionary were amputee, cane, invalid (now seen as a derogatory 
        term), and visually impaired. In the moral foundations dictionary, some examples of terms included compassion, kindness, sympathy, 
        victim, and unharmed. 
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
        According to the data collected, on average, the probability that a moral foundation term appears is 1.39 times higher when a disability term is 
        present than when a disability term is not present. Additionally, when breaking down the different moral foundation terms by group 
        (Harm/Care, Fairness/Unfairness, etc), there is a much higher average of moral foundations terms when a disability term is present 
        in the “harm” and “fairness” foundations. The rest of the terms did not exhibit a significant association when a disability term is 
        present versus when it is not. Specifically, the “authority” term did have a slight mean increase in moral foundation term count when 
        a disability term is present. However, the error mark is small and overlaps with the moral foundation term count when a disability 
        term is not present, so the increase is not significant, p.

        In conclusion, the United States’ News on the Web corpus suggests that individualist foundations were regarded with disability the 
        most and collectivist foundations the least.

  <h5> Mexico: </h5>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
        Collectivism, rather than individualism, is an important aspect of Mexican culture (Shkodriani & Gibbons, 1995). Collectivism is 
        defined as a view where social behavior is guided by the goals of the collective, such as the society, family, religion, or 
        political groups, unlike individualism which emphasizes individual success. (Awad et al., 2018) In this case, some moral foundations 
        that are associated with collectivism are authority/respect, loyalty/betrayal, and purity/sanctity. (Awad et al., 2018) Particularly, 
        collectivism in Mexican culture is embodied through familial obligation to support and provide for family members who may be in need 
        of assistance, which prioritize a communal goal rather than individual success. Additionally, Mexican collectivism emphasizes heritage 
        and cultural traditions. (Gregory & Munch, 1997)
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <ul>
      <p>
        The same method of compiling US data was used for news headlines. Two new dictionaries were found and extended in Spanish for moral 
        foundation-related and disability-related terms. Although the News on the Web Corpus had news headlines from Mexico, they were 
        translated to English. Therefore, another corpus dedicated solely to Mexican news headlines was used. 
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
        According to the data, in this corpus containing news headlines from Mexico, there is a higher mean in moral foundation terms when 
        a disability term is present than when it is not. The error margin when both a moral foundation and a disability term are present 
        is 0.0266, therefore there is a significant statistical change. The two terms that showed the greatest change in the number of moral 
        foundation terms when a disability term is present are “Harm” and “Purity.” The other three terms, “fairness”, “ingroup”, and 
        “authority”, showed very little significant change, and therefore are not considered to have an effect. 
      </p>
    </ul>

  <h5> Russia: </h5>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
        Russian culture also is more collectivist than the United States. However, it is also different from Mexican collectivism 
        because of its emphasis on authority and respect of the state, rather than family (Martz et al., 2009). Russian culture 
        prioritizes the success of the state or the society and the social norm (Realo & Allik, 1999) This is mainly due to Russia’s 
        history in the Soviet Union, which required full obedience of the citizens to authority. Additionally, under communist rule, 
        the success of the economy and of the state was prioritized above any personal gain due to the nature of communism. (Realo & Allik, 
        1999) However, with this version of collectivism, Russian culture may exhibit alienation of different groups that do not match 
        the social norms or the people, which is different from the embracement/welcoming of members through familial obligation in Mexico. 
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
        The same method for compiling the data shown was used. However, there was no dictionary available on moral foundations or 
        disability related terms. Therefore, OLMo-2 (32B), a 32-billion parameter large language model (LLM) was used to translate 
        terms from the previous moral foundations and disability dictionaries in English to Russian. These translations were then 
        confirmed by a native speaker. Because of the translations in the News on the Web corpus of Russian articles and headlines, 
        a corpus in the Russian language was found and utilized in collecting the data. 
      </p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
        Russian Lenta Corpus indicates that “Fairness and Injustice” (individualizing) and “Authority and Subversion” (binding) moral 
        foundations were mentioned the most when a disability term is present and the other foundations, “Care and Harm”, “Purity and 
        Sanctity”, and “Ingroup” the least.
      </p>
    </ul>

  <h5> Conclusion: </h5>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <p>
        As mentioned before, the United States has less of a collectivist society than Russia and Mexico, which still differ from each 
        other nonetheless. Similarly, as data suggests, the US, Russia, and Mexico also differ in moral foundations. For instance, the 
        US culture emphasizes purely individualistic foundations, such as “care/harm” and “fairness/injustice”, whereas Russian news 
        headlines mostly utilized the “fairness/injustice” and “authority” foundations, and Mexico the “care/harm” and “purity” foundations.
