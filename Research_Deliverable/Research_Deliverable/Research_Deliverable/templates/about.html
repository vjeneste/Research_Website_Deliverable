  <!-- Paragraph #1 -->

        Countries differ in language and culture, potentially creating differences in how social groups are represented. Is there a universal set of values associated with social groups across countries and cultures? Or does it depend on what values we’re surrounded by in our environment? In the United States, Russia, and Mexico, people with disabilities are a social group that experiences stigma and which are potentially bound up with collective moral values, that is, there is a sense of “right” and “wrong” when talking about that social group. However, the universal similarities across counties may end there. Here, we ask whether there is a relationship between a cultures’ degree of individualism and collectivism–a society’s expectation of an individual, either emphasizing freedom of the individual or the community–, and how they represent disabilities?

        Here, we investigated whether representations of disability in news media varied across three countries that themselves differ in terms of collectivism 
        and individualism: Mexico, Russia, and the United States. Our goal was to document the different ways in which moral values embedded in different cultures 
        condition the representations of marginalized social groups whose place in society is often understood in moralized terms.

        In the Mexico and Russia datasets, both individualist and collectivist moral values were used when talking about disability in the media (versus when 
        disability was not a topic). Mexican media emphasized the “purity” value (collectivist) and the “harm” value (individualist), whereas Russia used the 
        “authority” value (collectivist) and the “fairness” value (individualist). In contrast, the US media saw exclusively individualist moral foundations 
        associated with disability, utilizing the “care” and “fairness” values. These results indicate that there are  differences in the moral or value 
        representations of disabled peoples across countries, that vary in terms of a country's individualism and collectivism. However, in all three countries, 
        the topic of disability is referred to as a moral topic, meaning no matter what values the culture may have, there is a sense of responsibility, either as 
        an individual or as a society, to helping or interacting with people with disabilities.
